I am Gian Marco Oddo, 33 years old. Born in Verona, Italy, I moved to Switzerland three years ago. I used to be a professional Parkour athlete and currently hold two Guinness World Records in the field.

Currently, I am a Quantitative Research Analyst with two years of experience in quantitative finance and data science, working for a hedge fund startup. My expertise encompasses tail-risk hedging strategies, risk management, options trading, and volatility analysis, with a strong foundation in ML and AI.

I specialize in analyzing large-scale datasets with an emphasis on granular precision and signal extraction. I possess enterprise-grade proficiency in Python and R, and I am familiar with C++.

At Fourth Quadrant Investment Group, I am focused on building quantitative investment strategies and data infrastructure. I am developing tail-risk hedging frameworks and multi-asset backtesting engines, while actively conducting R&D on advanced ML frameworks, including multi-agent architectures and scalable cloud deployment.

My background includes co-designing synthetic order book simulations at SIX Swiss Exchange, automating risk analytics pipelines, and developing the pyriskmgmt Python library. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from both my MSc in Finance at USI (receiving the Top Student Award) and my Bachelor's at UNIVR.
